## 🧐 What is Palette?

```
💡 An Intermediary Platform designed to connect Amateur Artists and Clients.
```

It is an intermediary platform linking the Artists who may require some large spaces (eg. walls, streets, cafes, .. etc) to the Clients who are willing to provide such spaces. 

## 🙀 Issues?

```
💡 For Amateur Artists,  they lack intermediaries specialised for  connecting them to the Clients.
```

I happened to have a lot of friends from Art Majors, and have seen interesting projects that they have done.  

One interesting point I found from their projects, after asking my friends on how they get a venue for their large scale projects, involving the use of large spaces, was that they contact the property owners individually either by their mobiles or by Instagram. 

This could be easily addressed if there existed a specialised platform linking these two Market participants. 

## 🎁 What Values can Palette Generate?

```
💡 It is addressing the ‘Asymmetric Information’ that persists in the Market. Thereby Creating social values both to the Amateur Artists and Clients.
```

It may generate reciprocal values. For Artists, they may get venues they could do a large scale projects without spending too much time contacting the property owners. For Clients, they could save costs and time for decorating their properties.
